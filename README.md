# **ML- Lith-ion power - Unsupervised learning - KMeans Clustering**

### Problem Statement :

Lith-ion power is the largest producer of electric vechicle(e-vehicle) batteries.

They provide batteries on rent to e-vechicle drivers. Drivers rent a battery typically for a day and thereafter replacing it with a charged battery from the company.

Lith-ion power has a variable pricing model based on the driver's driving history. Battery life depends on factors such as over speeding, distance driven per day, etc.

**`Created a cluster model where drivers were grouped together based on the driving data and group the datapoints so that drivers will be incentivized based on the cluster.`**
